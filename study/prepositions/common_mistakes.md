## 💡 避免错误的学习策略

### 1. 建立"介词网络"

不要孤立记忆介词，要建立关联：

```
时间网络：
- 点：at (at 7:00)
- 线：on (on Monday)
- 面：in (in May)

空间网络：
- 内：in (in the box)
- 点：at (at the door)
- 表：on (on the table)
```

### 2. 记忆固定搭配

很多介词用法是固定的，需要整体记忆：

```
动词 + 介词：
- listen to
- look at
- wait for
- arrive at/in
- agree with

形容词 + 介词：
- good at
- interested in
- different from
- afraid of
```

### 3. 对比学习

把容易混淆的介词放在一起对比：

```
in/at/on (时间)
in/at/on (地点)
in/into (静/动)
on/onto (静/动)
through/across (内部/表面)
between/among (两者/多者)
```

### 4. 大量阅读和模仿

- 在阅读中注意介词的用法
- 背诵含有介词的句子
- 模仿地道的表达
