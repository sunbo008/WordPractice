A boy had a pet fly.
He named him Fly Guy. And Fly Guy could
say the boy's name—


Chapter 1
One day, Fly Guy went
with Buzz, Mom, and Dad on a long trip.




They drove until dinnertime.
They stopped at a hotel.
"Yay!" said Buzz. "I love hotels!"


"Cool room," said Buzz.
" Time for dinner," said Dad. " There is a nice restaurant downstairs," said Mom,
" but Fly Guy can't go there."

"Fly Guy can eat outside,"
said Buzz. "Right, Fly Guy?"




Fly Guy flew outside.




He found a
trash can.




He found a puddle.


He found a sticky spot.




He found the biggest, slimiest
garbage can ever.




But he didn't
find anything that he wanted to eat.

Chapter 2
Then Fly Guy smelled something wonderful.




Fly Guy followed
the smell.




At last, he found where he
wanted to eat!




Fly Guy needed to wash
before dinner.




He spied a small round
bathtub with warm
brown water. Perfect!




Fly Guy jumped in.




He washed his face and hands.




He washed his armpits.




He washed between his toes.

Chapter 3
Fly Guy's bathtub was picked
up and carried to another room.




It was set down on a table
in front of a lady.

The lady screamed, " Waiter!
There's a fly in my soup!"




The waiter grabbed Fly Guy's bathtub and threw it...




...into another lady's soup.

That lady jumped up. Her soup
and the first lady's soup
and Fly Guy went flying...




... onto a gentleman's head.

The gentleman jumped up.
The soup and Fly Guy
and the gentleman's hair went flying....


Everyone jumped up. Everyone's
soup and Fly Guy and the
gentleman's hair went flying.

Fly Guy still needed a bath.
Buzz, Mom, and Dad needed a bath.




Everyone needed a bath.
"Last one in the pool is a rotten egg!" yelled Buzz.
