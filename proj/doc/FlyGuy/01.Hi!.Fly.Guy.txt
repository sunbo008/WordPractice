Chapter 1


A fly went flying.


He was looking
for something to eat—


something tasty,


something slimy.




A boy went walking.


He was looking for
something to catch—
something smart,
something for
The Amazing Pet Show.




They met.


The boy caught the fly
in a jar.
"A pet!" he said.


The fly was mad.
He wanted to be free. He stomped his foot
and said— BUZZ!


The boy was surprised.
He said, "You know my name! You are the smartest pet in the world!"


Chapter 2
Buzz took the fly home.


"This is my pet," Buzz said to Mom and Dad.
"He is smart. He can say my name. Listen!"


Buzz opened the jar. The fly flew out.


"Flies can't be pets!" said
Dad. "They are pests!" He got the fly swatter. The fly cried— BUZZ!


And Buzz came to the rescue. "You are right," said Dad.
"This fly is smart!"


"He needs a name," said Mom. Buzz thought for a minute.
"Fly Guy," said Buzz.


It was time for lunch. Buzz gave Fly Guy
something to eat.


Fly Guy was happy.


Chapter 3


Buzz took Fly Guy to
The Amazing Pet Show.


The judges laughed.
"Flies can't be pets," they said. "Flies are pests!"




Buzz was sad.
He opened the jar.
"Shoo, Fly Guy," he said. "Flies can't be pets."


But Fly Guy liked Buzz.

He had an idea.
He did some fancy flying.




The judges were amazed. "The fly can do tricks,"
they said. "But flies can't be pets."


Then Fly Guy said—


BUZZ!


The judges were more amazed. "The fly knows the boy's
name," they said. "But flies
can't be pets."


Fly Guy flew high, high, high
into the sky!


Then he dived down, down,
down into the jar.

"The fly knows his jar!" the
judges said. "This fly is a pet!"
So they let Fly Guy in the show.
