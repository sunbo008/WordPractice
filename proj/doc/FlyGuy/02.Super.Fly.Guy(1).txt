A boy had a pet fly.
The fly was named Fly Guy. Fly Guy could say the boy's
name—



Chapter 1    One day Fly Guy went to school with Buzz.




BUZZ




Fly Guy learned about reading and phonics.



He learned about art.












Then it was lunchtime.
Fly Guy loved the lunchroom.





He loved the dirty dishes.

He loved the garbage cans.





Fly Guy met the lunch lady. Her name was Roz.







"No flies in the
lunchroom!" Roz said. Fly Guy said—
BUZZ?



"This fly is smart," said Roz. "He knows my name!"


She fed Fly Guy chicken bones and fish heads in sour milk.
Fly Guy was happy.





Chapter 2

Roz's boss was not happy. "The children cannot eat in a room full of flies!"
he said. "You are fired!"




Roz was sad. Fly Guy was sad. Buzz and the children were sad because Roz was a good cook.





The next day, Roz was gone. Miss Muzzle was the new
lunch lady.




She made burnt peas and
turnips. No one in school
ate lunch—not even Fly Guy, who ate almost anything.













Everyone missed Roz.
Even the boss missed Roz.




That night, Buzz made a plan.


Chapter 3

The next day, Fly Guy went
to school again. In the
lunchroom Fly Guy said—




Miss Muzzle looked up.
Fly Guy boinked her on the nose.





Miss Muzzle cried, "No flies in my lunchroom!"




She grabbed her swatter and swung. She missed.

She missed again.




The boss was not happy. "The children cannot eat in this mess," he said.
"You are fired!"




The next day, Roz was back. "You are a super Fly Guy!"




Roz made a special garbage soup for Super Fly Guy.




Fly Guy was happy.


Everyone was happy.


FLY GUY is off to school.
Will he make trouble?
Or will he save the day?
