A boy had a pet fly.
He  named  him  Fly  Guy.
Fly Guy could say the boy's name—



Chapter 1   One day, Buzz and   Fly Guy were bored. Fly Guy said,




"Yeah," said  Buzz.
"Let's do something fun."





Buzz and Fly Guy went for a walk.




They played chase.




A girl was running.
A fly was chasing her.


"Don't worry," said Buzz. "Flies aren't pests.
They are pets."




"I   know," said   the   girl. "This is my pet.
Her  name  is  Fly  Girl."

Chapter 2

Buzz  said, "This  is  Fly  Guy. He can do tricks."


"Fly Girl can do tricks, too!" said the girl.
"Fly Guy eats gross stuff,"

said Buzz.


"Fly Girl eats grosser stuff!" said the girl.


"Fly Guy can say my name,"

said      Buzz.




"Fly Girl can say my name, too!" said the girl.




"Do you want to play
on the swings?" said Buzz. "Sure," said Liz.

Chapter 3


Fly Guy and Fly Girl sat side by side.




Fly Guy said,


That is fly talk for "You are nice."

Fly Girl said,


That is fly talk for "You are nice, too."


Fly Guy and Fly Girl
