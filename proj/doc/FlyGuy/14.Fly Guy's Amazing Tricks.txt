A boy had a pet fly.
He named him Fly Guy. And Fly Guy could
say the boy's name—

Chapter 1
Buzz's friends came to see
The Amazing Fly Guy Circus.


Buzz said, "Get ready
for Fly Guy's amazing new tricks!"




"Now," said Buzz,
" The Backstroke!"




"Now," said Buzz,
" The Dizzy Doozie!"

"And now," said Buzz,
" The Big Booger!"




" Time for supper," said
Mom. Buzz's friends all went home.

Chapter 2
At the dinner table, Buzz said, "Fly Guy learned
new tricks."


Fly Guy did The Backstroke
in Mom's milk.

Buzz cried, "Stop, Fly Guy!"
But Fly Guy didn't hear him.




Fly Guy did The Dizzy
Doozie around Dad's head.

Buzz cried, "Stop, Fly Guy!"
But Fly Guy didn't hear him.




Fly Guy did The Big Booger.
Buzz caught him.




"Stop, Fly Guy!" he said.
"Let's clean up this mess."

Chapter 3
Outside, Buzz said to Fly Guy, " I have an idea. Do
your tricks only when you hear the word NOW. "


A big kid walked by.
He laughed. "Are you talking to a bug?"
Buzz didn't answer.

The kid said, "Do you
have bug brains?" Buzz didn't answer.




The kid said, "Bug got your
tongue?" Buzz didn't answer.




"Answer me!" yelled the kid.
"NOW!"

Fly Guy heard the word
"NOW!"




Fly Guy did The Backstroke.




Then Fly Guy did
The Dizzy Doozie.




And then Fly Guy did
The Big Booger.

The kid yelled, "Get
out of my face!"


He bumped into a garbage can.




A zillion angry flies chased
the big kid away.


Buzz said, "Fly Guy, here's a
new trick for you."




"High Fivezzz!"
