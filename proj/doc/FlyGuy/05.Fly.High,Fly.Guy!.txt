A boy had a pet fly.
He named him Fly Guy. Fly Guy could say
the boy's name—


Chapter 1


One day Buzz said,

"It's time to take
a road trip."



Fly Guy wanted to go, too.  "He's too little," said Mom. "He might get lost."




"Sorry," said Dad.
"Fly Guy stays home."


He shut the trunk.
"Okay, let's hit the road!"





The family drove and drove.












They stopped for a picnic. Mom opened the trunk.
Fly Guy flew out.


Dad said, "How did he get in there?"




"Just  don't  lose him," said Mom and Dad.
"Now, let's eat!"




Chapter 2

They drove to the beach.












Then it was time to go. Mom   and   Dad   said,
"Is Fly Guy lost?"


"No," said        Buzz.

"Here    he    is!"




They drove to

the     art     museum.

Then it was time to go. Mom   and   Dad   said,
"Is Fly Guy lost?"


"No," said       Buzz.

"Here    he    is!"












They  drove  to the  fun  park.




















Then it was time to go. Mom and Dad said,
"Is Fly Guy lost?"


"No," said         Buzz.

"Here    he    is!"




Chapter 3   "It's time to go home," said Mom.
"Let's hit the road," said Dad.


They drove


and drove

But they did not get home. "We're lost," said      Mom
and    Dad.




Buzz and Fly Guy had an idea.  Buzz  said, "Fly  high, Fly  Guy!"




Fly Guy flew high into the sky. He used his super fly eyes
to spy their house.




Fly Guy led the way home.




"Thank you, Fly  Guy," said Mom and Dad.
"You saved the day!




Oh, no! Is Fly Guy lost?
