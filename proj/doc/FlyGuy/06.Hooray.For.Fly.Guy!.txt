A boy had a pet fly.
He  named  him  Fly Guy. Fly Guy could say
the  boy's  name—


BUZZ


Chapter 1


Fly Guy went with Buzz to play football


Coach said, "We  need one  more  player  for  the  big game."


Buzz said,
"Fly Guy can play."





Coach laughed
"Flies can't play football."


Buzz   said, "Fly   Guy, show him what you can do."
Fly Guy kicked the ball.




Buzz said, "I was right," said Coach. "Flies can't play football. But he can come to the
game."





Chapter 2

It was the day before the big game. Buzz made a
helmet for Fly Guy.




They played football.


They did jumping jacks.


They planned a secret play.


They made up a
touchdown dance.


They went to the big game. Coach said, "A new player
joined our team"


Fly Guy sat on the bench.


The game started. His team scored.
Fly Guy cheered.


The other team scored. Fly Guy worried.
The other team scored a lot!


Chapter 3

Finally, there was one    second left in the game.




The other team was ahead. They were about to
score again.




And   the   new
player was hurt.





Coach said, "Okay, Fly Guy. You can play now.
The game is lost anyway."




Buzz   said, "It's   time for our secret play"




Fly Guy went to the line.





The other team snapped
the ball to their quarterback.




The boy dropped the ball.


Buzz picked it up and ran.


He     scored!




Fly Guy and Buzz did their

touchdown dance.




The      team      cheered. "We      won! Hooray for Fly Guy!"
