A boy had a pet fly.
He named him Fly Guy. And Fly Guy could
say the boy's name—

Chapter 1

It was a dark and stormy
night. Buzz and Fly Guy were playing.

Buzz made puzzles
for both of them.




Buzz made a drawing
for both of them.




Finally, Buzz said,
" Time for bed, Fly Guy. "




Fly Guy said,




As Buzz fell asleep,
he wondered, " What is Fly Guy making?"

Chapter 2
Late that night a strange light woke up Buzz.


Fly Guy was making
something in his laboratory.




He was making a monster!




Fly Guy turned on the power.
The monster sat up.




Buzz cried, "It's Frankenfly!"




Frankenfly heard Buzz.
He stood up.


He walked to the bed.




Frankenfly picked up Buzz.




Fly Guy yelled,




Fly Guy shut off the power.

Frankenfly dropped Buzz
and fell onto the bed.

Chapter 3

Buzz fell out of bed and woke up. It was morning.


"Wow!" said Buzz. "That
was a  bad dream."




Fly Guy was not in his bed.




He was asleep on the desk.


"Fly Guy," said Buzz, "did you
make something last night?"




Fly Guy said,




"You made me?" asked Buzz.




"YEZZZ!" said Fly Guy.
He pointed to a piece of paper. "It's me!" said Buzz.


"It's a painting of you
and me!" said Buzz.




"How did you paint this? My brushes are too big for you."




Buzz said, " We are the BEST
best friends ever!"
