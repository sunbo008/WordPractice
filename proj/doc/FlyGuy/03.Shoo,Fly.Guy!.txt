Chapter 1
A boy had a pet fly.
The boy called his pet Fly Guy. Fly Guy could say the boy's
name—


Buzz played with Fly Guy.



Buzz made him a glass house.



Best of all, Buzz fed him.


Fly Guy's favorite food was brown, oozy,
lumpy, and smelly.












One day Fly Guy went flying by himself.




























When  he came  home, Buzz was gone.




Dear Fly Guy
Where    are    you?
We  are  going
on   a    picnic.
back  soon.
LOVE Buzz



Fly Guy was hungry. So off he flew.

Chapter 2




Fly Guy flew until he  saw something to eat.


It  wasn't  brown, oozy, lumpy, or smelly. But it was brown. Close enough!




A boy shouted,
"That is my hamburger!"


"Shoo, fly!"





Fly Guy flew on until he saw something else.

It wasn't brown, lumpy, or smelly. But it was oozy.
Close enough!




A girl yelled,
"That is my pizza!"




"Shoo, fly!"









Fly Guy flew on until
he saw something else.

It wasn't brown, oozy, or smelly. But it was lumpy. Close enough!




A dog growled,
"Those are my bones."




"Shoo, fly!"









Fly Guy flew on until he saw something else.


It  wasn't  brown, oozy, or lumpy. But it was smelly. Close enough!


A bird squawked,
"That is my roadkill."




"Shoo, fly!"




Chapter  3


Fly Guy was very hungry. And he was very tired.
He looked around.
Fly Guy was very lost.


He    flew    on    and    on  and   on   and
on and on and on until


Fly Guy saw something. Could it be? Yes!


It was brown, oozy, lumpy, and smelly.


"You found our picnic!"   cried Buzz. "And here is
your favorite-Shoo Fly Pie!" Fly Guy was very happy!




FLY GUY is hungry.
He wants something
brown and smelly.
Yuck!
