A young boy named Buzz had a pet fly.
No one knows why he had a pet fly.
Buzz named him Fly Guy.


Chapter 1


One day Buzz went to visit his grandma. Fly Guy went, too.


Grandma was happy to see Buzz.
She ran to hug him.


"Hi, Grandma!" said Buzz.
"I want you to meet my pet . . ."




Grandma said—


and she swallowed Fly Guy.




Buzz didn't know why she swallowed Fly Guy.


Chapter 2


Fly Guy went down a deep dark hole.




At the bottom of the hole, he came to a wet place.




He looked around for a while. Then he wanted to leave.




He started up the hole.




Just then, Grandma swallowed a spider to catch Fly Guy.




She swallowed a bird to catch the spider.

Fly Guy cried,

"I'm up here!" yelled Buzz.




Out came Fly Guy.

Out came the spider,
the bird, the cat, the dog, the goat, and the cow.




And everyone lived happily ever after, of course!
