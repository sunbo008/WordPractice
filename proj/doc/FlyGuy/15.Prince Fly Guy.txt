A boy had a pet fly.
He named him Fly Guy. And Fly Guy could
say the boy's name —



Chapter 1
One night, Buzz said,
"I have homework to do.
I have to write a fairy tale. Can you help me, Fly Guy?"




" Well," said Buzz,
" how does this sound? Once upon a time … "




"Okay," said Buzz.
"Once upon a time,
there was an ugly troll."


"You don't like that?
Well, what about a smelly pig herder?"


"No? What about a
handsome prince?"




"Okay," said Buzz.
" The handsome prince
walked to the dark castle."


"Maybe instead of walking,"
said Buzz, "what if he rode to the dark castle?"


"No! I've got it! He flew
to the dark castle?"


Chapter 2
"At the dark castle,"
said Buzz, "the handsome
prince ate cold porridge."




" What if he kissed a frog?"




"I've got it! He rescued a
beautiful princess."




"But a giant lived in
the dark castle."


Chapter 3
" The giant chased the handsome prince and   the beautiful princess."




"He knocked them down
to the ground."


" The princess threw her crown."


"It hit the giant on the nose."


" The giant fell down."




"He ran away. "


" The prince and the
princess flew home."


" They made matching crowns."


"And they lived


happily ever after."


" The end," said Buzz.




"I like my fairy tale," said Buzz.
"Hey, want to write another one?"




"Okay. Once there was
a hairy dwarf . . . "
