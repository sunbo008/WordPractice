    "story": "How was your last holiday? I learned Chinese, sang and danced, and ate good food. I took pictures, climbed mountains, and had so much fun! We bought presents, rowed a boat, and saw elephants at the zoo. We also went skiing and went ice-skating. How did you get there? I got there by train. What an amazing vacation!"
