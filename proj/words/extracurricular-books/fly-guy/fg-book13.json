    "story": "It was a dark and stormy night. Buzz and Fly Guy were playing. Buzz made puzzles for both of them, then a drawing for both of them. Finally, Buzz said it's time for bed. Fly Guy said he would make something too. As Buzz fell asleep, he wondered what Fly Guy was making. Late that night, a strange light woke up Buzz. Fly Guy was making something in his laboratory - he was making a monster! Fly Guy turned on the power and the monster sat up. Buzz cried 'It's Frankenfly!' Frankenfly heard Buzz, stood up, walked to the bed and picked up Buzz. Fly Guy yelled and shut off the power. Frankenfly dropped Buzz and fell onto the bed. Buzz fell out of bed and woke up - it was morning! 'Wow! That was a bad dream,' said Buzz. Fly Guy was not in his bed - he was asleep on the desk. 'Did you make something last night?' asked Buzz. Fly Guy pointed to a piece of paper - it was a painting of Buzz and Fly Guy! 'How did you paint this? My brushes are too big for you.' Buzz said, 'We are the BEST best friends ever!'"
