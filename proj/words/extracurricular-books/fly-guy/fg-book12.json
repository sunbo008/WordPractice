    "story": "One day, Fly Guy went with Buzz, Mom, and Dad on a long trip. They drove until dinnertime and stopped at a hotel. Buzz loved hotels and thought the room was cool. It was time for dinner at the restaurant downstairs, but Fly Guy couldn't go there. Buzz said Fly Guy could eat outside. Fly Guy flew outside and found a trash can, a puddle, a sticky spot, and the biggest slimiest garbage can ever, but he didn't find anything he wanted to eat. Then Fly Guy smelled something wonderful and followed the smell. He found where he wanted to eat! Fly Guy needed to wash before dinner. He spied a small round bathtub with warm brown water - perfect! Fly Guy jumped in and washed his face, hands, armpits, and between his toes. But Fly Guy's bathtub was picked up and carried to another room! It was set down on a table in front of a lady. The lady screamed 'Waiter! There's a fly in my soup!' The waiter grabbed Fly Guy's bathtub and threw it into another lady's soup. That lady jumped up and the soup went flying onto a gentleman's head! Everyone jumped up and everyone's soup went flying. Everyone needed a bath. 'Last one in the pool is a rotten egg!' yelled Buzz!"
