    "story": "Fly Guy went with Buzz to play football. Coach said they needed one more player for the big game. Buzz suggested Fly Guy could play, but Coach laughed and said flies can't play football. Fly Guy showed his kick, but Coach still said no. Before the big game, Buzz made a helmet for Fly Guy and they practiced - jumping jacks, a secret play, and a touchdown dance. At the game, a new player joined, but got hurt. The other team was ahead with one second left. Coach let Fly Guy play since the game seemed lost. Buzz and Fly Guy executed their secret play - when the other team's quarterback dropped the ball, Buzz picked it up, ran, and scored! They did their touchdown dance and won the game. Hooray for Fly Guy!"
