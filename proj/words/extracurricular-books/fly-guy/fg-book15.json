    "story": "One night, Buzz said he has homework to do - he has to write a fairy tale. He asked Fly Guy to help. Buzz started with 'Once upon a time there was an ugly troll.' Fly Guy didn't like that. Buzz tried 'a smelly pig herder.' No? 'What about a handsome prince?' Yes! The handsome prince walked to the dark castle. Maybe instead of walking, he rode? No! He flew to the dark castle! At the dark castle, the handsome prince ate cold porridge. What if he kissed a frog? No! He rescued a beautiful princess. But a giant lived in the dark castle. The giant chased the handsome prince and the beautiful princess. He knocked them down to the ground. The princess threw her crown and it hit the giant on the nose. The giant fell down and ran away. The prince and the princess flew home. They made matching crowns and lived happily ever after. The end! Buzz liked his fairy tale and wanted to write another one about a hairy dwarf!"
