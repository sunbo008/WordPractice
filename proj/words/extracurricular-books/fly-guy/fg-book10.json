    "story": "One day, Fly Guy was eating breakfast in Buzz's backpack. Buzz grabbed his backpack and went to school. At school, Fly Guy flew out. The teacher said they were going on a field trip to tour a factory. Buzz told Fly Guy to ride in his pocket. The class rode the bus to the factory. A tour guide led the class inside to a flyswatter museum. She showed them where they make flyswatters and gave each student one. Fred the Fly came to tell them more. Fred said flies play in slime, eat garbage, and are nasty! Fly Guy got mad. Fred shouted they need the Super Swatter 6000 - the flyswatter of the future! They brought out a tiny fly in a jar and released it. The Super Swatter started swatting. Fly Guy flew to save the little fly and took it to an open window, flying past Fred and the machines. The Super Swatter kept swatting everything! Fred yelled to stop and ended all factory tours. Back at school, everyone agreed Fly Guy was a hero!"
