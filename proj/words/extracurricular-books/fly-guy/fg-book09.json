    "story": "One night, Buzz made a comic book about superheroes. He read it to Fly Guy. The story was about Buzz Boy who shrunk to the same size as Fly Guy. Buzz Boy got bad news - Fly Guy couldn't come on the adventure. Pirates took their house to a dragon cave on an island far away. Buzz Boy saw a sleeping dragon. With his super strength, Buzz Boy turned the dragon around. The dragon woke up and shot fire outside. They ran to the beach and found their house on a pirate ship. Fly Guy used his super skeleton key to unlock the door - they were at the top of the pirate ship! They made friends with the dragon and let him join their team as Dragon Dude! Fly Guy loved the superhero story and wanted to read it again!"
