    "story": "Buzz played with Fly Guy and made him a glass house. Fly Guy's favorite food was brown, oozy, lumpy, and smelly. One day Fly Guy went flying by himself. When he came home, Buzz was gone - they went on a picnic. Fly Guy was hungry and flew off to find food. He tried a hamburger, but a boy shooed him away. He tried pizza, but a girl yelled at him. He tried bones, but a dog growled. He tried roadkill, but a bird squawked. Fly Guy was very hungry, tired, and lost. He flew on and on until he saw something brown, oozy, lumpy, and smelly - it was Buzz's picnic with Shoo Fly Pie! Fly Guy was very happy!"
