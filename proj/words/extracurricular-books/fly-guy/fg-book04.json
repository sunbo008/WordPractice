    "story": "Buzz went to visit his grandma with Fly Guy. Grandma was happy to see Buzz and ran to hug him. But when Buzz wanted to introduce his pet, Grandma accidentally swallowed Fly Guy! Fly Guy went down a deep dark hole and came to a wet place at the bottom. He wanted to leave and started up the hole. But then Grandma swallowed a spider to catch Fly Guy, then a bird to catch the spider, a cat to catch the bird, a dog to catch the cat, a goat to catch the dog, and a cow to catch the goat! Just as Grandma was about to swallow a horse, Fly Guy cried for Buzz. Out came Fly Guy and all the animals. Everyone lived happily ever after!"
