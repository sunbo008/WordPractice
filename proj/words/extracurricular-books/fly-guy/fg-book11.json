    "story": "One day, Dad asked who wants to go for a ride. Buzz and Fly Guy said yes! Everyone buckled up and they hit the road with the windows down. Buzz stuck his hand out and pretended it was flying. Suddenly, wind blew in the car and carried Fly Guy out into a passing truck! Buzz cried 'Follow that truck!' Meanwhile, Fly Guy tumbled into the truck driver's mouth. The driver spit Fly Guy out the window and into a passing motorboat. Buzz cried 'Follow that boat!' On the boat, Fly Guy saw a bug on a hook and jumped into a passing train. On the train, Fly Guy surprised a sleepy elephant who blew him onto an airplane! The pilot turned on the wipers. Then a rocket roared up from the ground. Buzz and Dad landed and worried if Fly Guy would survive. But Fly Guy was safe - the rocket didn't take him to space! They were reunited!"
