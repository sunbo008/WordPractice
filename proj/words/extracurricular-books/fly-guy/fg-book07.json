    "story": "Buzz and Fly Guy went outside to play hide-and-seek. Fly Guy always hid in the garbage can because he liked to eat while Buzz looked for him. Buzz found him easily and then hid in the garden shed. Fly Guy found a way in. When it was Fly Guy's turn to hide again, he hid in the garbage can. But the garbageman came and dumped the garbage into the truck and drove away! Buzz's dad followed the truck to the town dump. Buzz ran into the dump looking for Fly Guy. A zillion flies answered his call, making it hard to find Fly Guy. Buzz spied flies hiding, eating, and landing, but none were Fly Guy. Buzz was sad and kicked cans. Then he remembered they were still playing a game and gave up. He heard a voice from above - it was Fly Guy! I spy Fly Guy!"
