    "story": "Buzz's friends came to see The Amazing Fly Guy Circus. Buzz said 'Get ready for Fly Guy's amazing new tricks!' Fly Guy did The Backstroke, The Dizzy Doozie, and The Big Booger. Then it was time for supper and all friends went home. At the dinner table, Buzz said Fly Guy learned new tricks. Fly Guy did The Backstroke in Mom's milk. Buzz cried 'Stop, Fly Guy!' but Fly Guy didn't hear him. Then Fly Guy did The Dizzy Doozie around Dad's head. Buzz cried 'Stop!' but Fly Guy didn't hear. Fly Guy did The Big Booger and Buzz caught him. 'Let's clean up this mess,' said Buzz. Outside, Buzz had an idea - 'Do your tricks only when you hear the word NOW.' A big kid walked by and laughed, 'Are you talking to a bug? Do you have bug brains? Bug got your tongue?' Buzz didn't answer. The kid yelled 'Answer me! NOW!' Fly Guy heard 'NOW!' and did all three tricks. The kid bumped into a garbage can and a zillion angry flies chased him away. Buzz said 'Fly Guy, here's a new trick for you - High Fivezzz!'"
