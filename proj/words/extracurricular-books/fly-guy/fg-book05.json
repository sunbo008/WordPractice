    "story": "Buzz's family wanted to take a road trip. Mom and Dad said Fly Guy was too little and might get lost, so he should stay home. But Fly Guy secretly hid in the trunk! When they stopped for a picnic, Fly Guy flew out. They drove to the beach, art museum, and fun park. Every time, Mom and Dad asked if Fly Guy was lost, but Buzz found him. When it was time to go home, they drove and drove but got lost. Buzz had an idea - Fly high, Fly Guy! Fly Guy flew high into the sky and used his super fly eyes to spy their house. He led the way home and saved the day!"
