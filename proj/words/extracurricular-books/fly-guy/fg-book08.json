    "story": "One day, Buzz and Fly Guy were bored and decided to do something fun. They went for a walk and played chase. A girl was running with a fly chasing her. Buzz told her flies aren't pests, they are pets. The girl said she knew - the fly was her pet Fly Girl! Buzz showed that Fly Guy could do tricks and eat gross stuff. The girl said Fly Girl could do tricks too and eat grosser stuff! Both flies could say their owners' names. Buzz and Liz went to play on the swings. Fly Guy and Fly Girl sat side by side and talked in fly talk. Fly Guy said 'You are nice' and Fly Girl said 'You are nice, too.' They talked and talked, then both said 'Let's be friends.' That was fun! Fly Guy has a new friend!"
